bio: "Dr. James Frew is an associate professor at UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. He teaches environmental informatics, which synthesizes computer and earth sciences, and GIS. His experiences in interdisciplinary work began in the Geography department at UCSB, where social and physical sciences united through spatial theory and using maps for organizing knowledge. In a room full of computer scientists and physical earth scientists he was once referred to as the “Rosetta Stone” of their interdisciplinary project. Frew is currently a principal investigator on the UCSB Crossroads interdisciplinary project for Visualizing Environmental Models."

## How do you define interdisciplinary education?

Educating in an environment where the disciplines are forced to interact by the nature of the way things are organized
Multidisciplinary as a pre-condition to interdisciplinary 
Interdisciplinary is where a problem doesn’t fall into a single category 
Can be solving a problem in one discipline while using tools from another discipline - but there are also obvious points of tangency -  Geography commanilaties include space and maps - how do we organize knowledge?  
The culture of geography is always asking about people 
“Bullshit in two languages” or you can understand where the disciplines overlap and how to communicate across it - your ability to understand and communicate
There’s switching between something (a set of single disciplines) but there’s also being in the mix
one way of looking at it is if you can convince discipline A that you're part of discipline B. I'm very good at convincing geographers that I am a computer scientist and convincing computer scientists that I am a geographer. 
And one of the things that I would say defines interdisciplinary is your ability to do that… Your ability to understand when people seem to be disagreeing but they're not really because they're talking about the same thing in different terms.
Interdisciplinary doesn't work unless it's people who can do that. You know you can translate across across the boundaries and the only way you get that is by getting some depth in both, through the both of the disciplines 
multi or interdisciplinary works where there are obvious points of tangency not just necessarily a problem that falls between them but techniques that bridge the gap.


## How do you describe your teaching “field?” (as in research field)

First ‘big data’ project before anyone used the term big data - cutting edge of data storage - leaders were Dozier and a big CS guy and Frew was in the center “Rosetta Stone” 
“Geographer by training and a computer scientist by necessity” 
Computer science didn’t really exist back in the day - started as a fusion between electrical engineering and mathematics
Computer science became defined when they shifted from how to compute things to how to organize things. The field of data theory 
Sometimes the gaps between disciplines are so large that they don’t need bridges they need an entire background
The Geography department here which I grew up in is a is a good example of that because traditionally geography is very is it has a social science aspect and a physical science. And it's really unusual to get them together under the same roof. 
As geographers we think in terms of space we use maps we use certain kinds of reasoning you know whether it's the tools or the models or the apologies I mean not the computational surfaced in the way that we organize knowledge


## What creates a successful interdisciplinary education experience?

Bren: Economists at Bren are so different from normal economists - we can be better at what we do when we work with people from other places 
“Economics is very protective of its brand”
If Bren didn’t have the MESM program there would be less interdisciplinary work. 
“Just cross-disciplinary enough to not make a fool of yourself” 
I think that teaching if Bren was a collection of people same collection of people and we didn't have a MESM program I think it would be much less interesting place. I think that the MESM program keeps us alive. Yeah. You know for forcing us to think about you know how do we boil down what we're doing so we can pour it into these people that are going to just cross disciplinary enough to not make fools of themselves 
You know because of this incredible range of backgrounds in the Master's students you know they're in a class with somebody who you know strengthens in econ and strength the geology and the strength is in policy. And so they wind up helping each other. And so a lot of this cross disciplinary experience happens just while they're working on their homework.
