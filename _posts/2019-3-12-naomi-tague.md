bio: "Dr. Naomi Tague is an associate professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management and an ecohydrologist. Her research interests include the interactions between hydrologic and ecosystem processes, and how they change with climate and land use. She uses a model to answer research questions regarding ecosystem health and hydrologic patterns. Dr. Tague practices interdisciplinary work in several areas - she is a principal investigator on the SERI fire project, which focuses on the impacts of wildfires on ecosystems and society, and the UCSB Crossroads project on visualizing environmental models."

## How do you define interdisciplinary education?

Interdisciplinary v. multidisciplinary v. transdisciplinary
Research that involved perspectives, theories, or methods from different disciplines. 
In interdisciplinary work, what is an entire field of research for one can be a parameter in the model 
How tightly linked are the disciplines?

## How do you describe your teaching “field?” (as in research field)

Ecohydrology - hydrology and ecology and even ecosystem ecology.  
Multidisciplinary - ecologic model & hydrologic model.  
Interdisciplinary - coupled ecohydrologic model.  
Seri fire - working closely with economists - talking to each other and trying to understand - how do they think about it? How do they formulate questions? 

## What creates a successful interdisciplinary education experience?

It takes time and conversation to do that - asking questions and trying to understand the other’s frame of mind 
If you can’t articulate how your discipline thinks The hard part isn’t knowing the other field, it’s knowing your own field. 
Exposure to other disciplines, not becoming experts. Our PhD students most of them have depth in some sort of area. Some of our students get jobs in economic departments. They get jobs in hydrology departments, or ecology departments. 
It's because all the way along, you are around people who have expertise in disciplines that are different from your own. 
But I think it’s the informal ways that count the most. It's going to the PhD coffee hour. It's going to the camping. It’s just being around. Its being an advisor on a MESM project. It's going to hear talks every once in a while that are from outside your discipline
they had lots of opportunities where they had to articulate what they do to someone in a different discipline. And if that's the only skill we get, that’s invaluable. Our PhD students are much better able to jump into interdisciplinary solving problem solving or interdisciplinary research collaboration because they know how to describe what they do to someone who is well educated, who may be an expert in another field. but doesn't know their field. And informal opportunities for articulating that is such a critical skill because all interdisciplinary research starts from understanding what other people do at a really high sophisticated PhD level.
